# Mosaic-Sprint-4


Greetings, 

In my repository I provided both the ZIP file that contains all class associated with my assignment in order for it to compile effectively. In addition, I add the main JAVA file for you guys to visually see the code instead of downloading the zip file and decompressing it. 

In order to run the ZIP file, after downloading it, decompress the file and store it in a location in your computer device. To run the file simply just --
 Javac *java
 java Mosaic

If you guys have any questions on my implementation please feel free to email me or comment on my post in the discussion board.
